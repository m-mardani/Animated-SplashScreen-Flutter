# Animated Splash Screen with Flutter


Hey guys!! I hope you all are enjoying aweasom flutter! In this Project , I'm going to create splash screen with animation and pre-defined time.

Here delay is for 10 seconds. So, after 10 seconds SplashScreen will be replaced.

In the realm of Flutter, altering the default splash screen directly is not a straightforward endeavor. When you create a splash-screen widget within your Flutter app, it will only appear once the default splash screen has had its momentâ€”resulting in an initial white screen until Flutter completes its initialization. This user experience can be seen as suboptimal from a design perspective.
 
Firstly you most get Json File and just replace with my project file.

Animated splash screens go beyond the static logo display. They capture the user's attention, immerse them in the app's theme, and set expectations for what's to come. By combining animations, transitions, and meaningful visuals, animated splash screens can communicate the app's essence, creating an emotional connection with the user from the very beginning.

One of the key advantages of animated splash screens is their ability to mask the actual loading time. By keeping users visually engaged, these screens can make the wait feel shorter, reducing the perceived loading time. This is crucial in creating a smooth and enjoyable user experience, as users are less likely to abandon an app due to long loading times.
